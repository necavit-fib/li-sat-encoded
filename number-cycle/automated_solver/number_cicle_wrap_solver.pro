/*
 * PROBLEM
 * Given the number of rows and columns of the grid and some labeled
 * cells, with labels {0,1,2,3}, wrap the labeled cells with either
 * 1, 2, 3 or no edges around, connecting the edges to form closed
 * cicles with no overlappings. 
 * 
 * SOLUTION
 * Add constraints to write the edges of the labeled cells and
 * constraints to close the cicles:
 *     - Cell constraints: a cell labeled "k" has exactly k edges
 *         surrounding it
 *     - Cicle constraints: to close a cicle, we must draw, for every
 *         grid intersection, either 0 or 2 incoming segments, thus
 *         closing the cicle and avoiding overlaps.
